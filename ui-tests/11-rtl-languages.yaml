# 11 - RTL Languages - Switch to Hebrew/Arabic, verify RTL layout

# Note: Changing app locale via Maestro may not be straightforward
# This test assumes the device/emulator locale can be changed, 
# or the app detects system locale

# For now, we'll verify the UI can handle potential RTL by checking settings
- tapOn:
    testTag: "settings_button"
- takeScreenshot: screenshots/11-settings-ltr

# If the device is set to Hebrew or Arabic locale, the UI should auto-flip
# Since we can't easily change device locale in Maestro, we'll document this test
# as requiring manual testing with different device locales

# Go back

# NOTE: To properly test RTL:
# 1. Change device language to Hebrew (עברית) or Arabic (العربية) in device settings
# 2. Relaunch app
# 3. Verify all text aligns right-to-left
# 4. Verify currency symbols appear on correct side
# 5. Verify buttons/icons mirror appropriately
# This test serves as a placeholder and documents the RTL verification need
